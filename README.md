# Wacky-Weather-App
- Designed an application using Open-Meteo's weather forecast and geolocation API to fetch the current weather data based on a specific location given by the user.
- Implemented the Swing Library in order to display the data in an easily readable graphic format using classes such as JFrame, JTextField, and JLabel
- Architected an application backend that parses the JSON data given by the API and correctly assigns the parsed data to the correct UI element in the GUI.

There are 2 ways to run this program. Included is a runnable .jar file (WackyWeatherApp.jar), which will run the application automatically. You can also view the source code and assets used in the src folder.
